                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of Rep With Me came about during the beginning week of finals in the spring semester of 2015 when we noticed how difficult it was to find someone with the perfect schedule to rep with. The benefits of exercise on the body are very commonly known. The physical benefits are advertised almost everywhere you look, but the mental and emotional benefits from exercise are commonly undervalued and fail to receive the attention they truly deserve. After enduring the brutal challenges, and obstacles of finals week we got together to figure out how we could solve this problem. During the summer of 2015 we teamed up and spent countless hours, and nights creating a solution.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why us? We have been friends for quite some time now, with a cornerstone of our relationship revolving around physical activity, and constantly competing with each other in school, sports, and the weight room.  We understand the difficulties that arise when you’re new to an area, and lack someone to rep with. Whether it is finding someone to help you achieve your goals, both mentally and physically, or simply finding someone to help you make it through your workout; Rep With Me will connect a repper in your area to help you solve these problems. We are extremely passionate on solving this problem and hope you will support us on our journey!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very simplest of forms Rep With Me connects reppers together who are working out in the same area. Partners can be chosen based on the exercise that is agreed upon, or by activities the gym offers in their area. We plan to release blog posts periodically, which will mostly be written to educate our reppers as well as serve as an outlet for us to share our personal experiences in the gym. These posts will include suggested workouts, balanced meals, health tips, and etiquette in the gym (and we may also include some music suggestions, so keep your ears open!). Whether you’re experienced, or completely new to the healthy lifestyle, Rep With Me will find ways to reward you on your consistency and your willingness to connect with others around you. Above all here at Rep With Me we want to motivate, and connect the world to enjoy the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle. </p>
